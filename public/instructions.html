<h2>Let's play with me</h2>
<p>It's llike you are at a coffee bar smoking gailliosie whilst perusing a screenplay, 
or at cocktail party hobnobbing with industry types trying to impress each 
other with how unimpressed - and unimpressable - they are, and stumble headwise and sidelong 
into the middle of a conversation. If the topic is of interest, sit a spell and knod and listen - mmmm..., 
Interject, correct, confide or convulse - resort to fisticuffs if your cause is just - mumble, shuffle and 
show off that snot bubble - if you must.</p> 
<p>	So please, - we implore you - join the conversation. An experiment in collaborative craftmanship. 
A collective composition attributable to a circle of jerks, close talkers, lurkers, and transients. 
A citizenry freshly spun, beporched and milling; around and about and about and around old 
ad hoc town square in the shadow of the palace of the empire of the commons and we it's giant 
petulant baby bloody axe wielding emperors. </p>
<p>	Add, edit or delete anything you like. If we don't like what you have to say we may 
deface your drivel and mock or flatout attack you personally to satiate our hunger for power, 
quench our thirst for blood and prop our delicate egos ever so gently up. This is our party after all. 
If you don't like it, fork it. We'll even provide you with a fresh crib, just like ours but customized to 
your liking - stocked fridge and all! A realm of your very own to rule with an iron fist (but get your own damn friends, loser, and leave ours alone)
