	It's llike you are at a coffee bar smoking gailliosie whilst perusing a screenplay, 
or at cocktail party hob-knobbing with industry types trying to impress each 
other with how unimpressed - and unimpressable - they are, and stumble headwise and sidelong 
into the middle of a conversation. If the topic is of interest, sit a spell and knod and listen - mmmm..., 
Interject, correct, confide or convulse - resort to fisticuffs if your cause is just - mumble, shuffle and 
show off that snot bubble - if you must. 
	So please, - we implore you - join the conversation. An experiment in collaborative craftmanship. 
A collective composition attributubalill to a circle of close talkers and lurking gawkers. A citizenry freshly 
spun, beporched and milling; around and about and about and around old ad hoc town square in the shadow 
of the palace of the epire of the commons and we a giant petulant baby king. 
	Add, edit or delete anything you like if we don't like what you have to say we may 
deface your drivel and mock or flatout attack you personally to satiate our hunger for power, quench our thirst 
for blood and prop our delicate egos just a little bit up. This is our party after all. If you don't like it, fork it. We'
ll even provide you with a fresh crib, just like ours but customized to your liking - stocked fridge and all! A 
realm of your very own to rule with an iron fist (but get your own damn friends, loser, and leave ours alone)
